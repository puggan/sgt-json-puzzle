# sgt-json-puzzle
Implementation of SGT-Puzzles as an JSON-API

["Simon Tatham's puzzle collection"](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/) have a lot great puzzle games.
Its fun to play them the normal way, but as a programmer it's also intresting to build bots to play them.

The goal of this project is to generate starts states for the games, and dilivery them as json.
